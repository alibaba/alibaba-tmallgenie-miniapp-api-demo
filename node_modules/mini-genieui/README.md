# Develop

1. Make sure `yarn` is installed. If not, run

```
npm install -g yarn
```

2. Run the following command to compile components from `src` into `demo/lib` folder. And open `demo` folder in [Alipay Miniapp IDE](https://docs.alipay.com/mini/ide/download) to view existing component demos

```
npm run dev
```

3. When developing new components, checkout a new branch

```
git checkout -b feat/your-component
```

Create a folder under `src` to write component source code. Also you can write a demo page under `demo/pages` for your comopennt to visulize and test it.

Make sure the component is well designed and tested. When everything is ready, create a Merge Request to master and set @佐轮 as reviewer. After reviewing, the branch will be merged and published to npm registry.
